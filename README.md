(Analyst At Work)

## Introduction
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, impacting revenue and growth. This project leverages Power BI to analyze customer data, identify churn patterns, and propose actionable retention strategies. By visualizing key insights, we can understand customer behavior and take proactive measures to improve retention rates.

### Problem Statement
Many companies struggle with customer attrition, losing a percentage of their customer base over time. The goal of this analysis is to:
- Identify factors contributing to churn.
- Segment customers based on behaviors and demographics.
- Develop data-driven retention strategies.
- Utilize Power BI dashboards to visualize key trends and insights.

## Data Preparation and Analysis
### Data check
- Inspected data for duplicates and other inconsisitency.
- Created new calculated fields and measures. (e.g.,Churn rate, Retention rate, Total revenue etc).

### Key Questions Explored
- What is the overall churn rate?
- Are there specific age groups more likely to churn?
- How does monthly spending impact retention?
- Do customers on short-term contracts churn more frequently?
- Does customer support interaction impact churn?


### Data Visualization with Power BI
To effectively present these insights, An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to visualise:
- Churn Rate Overview: Displays the total percentage of churned customers.
- Contract Type Analysis: Compares churn rates across different contract lengths.
- Monthly Charges & Churn: Correlation between customer spending and retention.
- Customer Support Interaction: Analyzing how support engagement impacts churn likelihood.

## Insights and Business Recommendations
### Insights
- Churn rate decreases as tenure increases. This means that customers tend to find more value over time.
- 76% of customers that opened technical tickets churned.
- Longer contracts engage more with the products than month to month customers.
- Short-term contract users (month-to-month plans) have the highest churn.
- 49.6% female engagement with multiple services.
- Customers who engage less with customer support tend to leave more often.
- Senior citizens engage more with the company products.
- Young customers (< 30 years) churn more frequently compared to older age groups.


### Recommendations
- Customers on monthly plans churn more often → Consider incentives for annual subscriptions.
