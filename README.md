# Customer Churn and Retention Analysis
(Analyst At Work)
### Introduction
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, impacting revenue and growth. This project leverages Power BI to analyze customer data, identify churn patterns, and propose actionable retention strategies. By visualizing key insights, we can understand customer behavior and take proactive measures to improve retention rates.

### Problem Statement

Many companies struggle with customer attrition, losing a percentage of their customer base over time. The goal of this analysis is to:

- Identify factors contributing to churn.

- Segment customers based on behaviors and demographics.

- Develop data-driven retention strategies.

- Utilize Power BI dashboards to visualize key trends and insights.

### Data Cleaning Steps:

- Removed missing or duplicate values.

- Standardized categorical data.

- Created new calculated fields for deeper insights (e.g., tenure groups, average monthly spend).

### Exploratory DAta analysis
Key questions explored:

What is the overall churn rate?

- Are there specific age groups more likely to churn?

- How does monthly spending impact retention?

- Do customers on short-term contracts churn more frequently?

- Does customer support interaction impact churn?

### Key Findings
 ```
Customers with higher monthly charges show a higher churn rate.

Short-term contract users (month-to-month plans) have the highest churn.

Customers who engage less with customer support tend to leave more often.

Young customers (< 30 years) churn more frequently compared to older age groups.

### Data Visualization with Power BI
To effectively present these insights, we developed an interactive Power BI dashboard including:

- Churn Rate Overview: Displays the total percentage of churned customers.

- Demographic Breakdown: Showcases churn distribution by age, gender, and location.

- Contract Type Analysis: Compares churn rates across different contract lengths.

- Monthly Charges & Churn: Correlation between customer spending and retention.

- Customer Support Interaction: Analyzing how support engagement impacts churn likelihood.


## Churn Insights & Business Recommendations

### Key Insights:

- Customers on monthly plans churn more often → Consider incentives for annual subscriptions.

- High spenders are more likely to churn → Introduce loyalty discounts or rewards.

- Customers who don't interact with support churn more → Implement proactive customer outreach.

### Recommendations:

- Offer discounts or bundled deals for customers at risk of churning.

- Improve customer engagement by personalized marketing and outreach programs.

- Enhance customer support strategies by introducing AI-driven chatbots or live support for high-risk customers.

- Introduce predictive churn models to proactively identify at-risk customers.
